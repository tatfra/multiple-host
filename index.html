    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>The croissant is a classic French pastry that has become a beloved breakfast staple worldwide. With its flaky layers and buttery flavor, it's no surprise that the croissant has become a favorite among pastry lovers everywhere. But where did this delicious pastry come from? In this article, we'll take a closer look at the history of the croissant. The exact origins of the croissant are somewhat disputed, but it's widely believed that it was created in Vienna, Austria in the 17th century. The croissant is said to have been inspired by the crescent-shaped banners used by the Ottoman Empire during their siege of Vienna in 1683. According to the legend, the bakers in Vienna were working through the night to create a new pastry to commemorate the victory over the Ottomans. They came up with a crescent-shaped pastry that was light, flaky, and buttery - the croissant was born.</p>
